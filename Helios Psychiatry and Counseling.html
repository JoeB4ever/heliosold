                                        Carlton is an ANCC board certified Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner. 
                                            He received his Masters of Science degree from Walden University. 
                                            Carlton started his nursing career working as a medical/surgical nurse in the 
                                            juvenile justice system as well as acute care hospital setting. He quickly noticed the 
                                            prevalence of mental illness among the individuals he cared for. This finding prompted 
                                            him to shift his focus solely towards mental health, where he worked in a nursing capacity
                                            for over 7 years.  In effort to reduce stigma and advocate for improved and continuous 
                                            access to mental health care, Carlton has remained committed and passionate to serving 
                                            individuals from all walks of life.

                                        Karen Farrar is a Master’s prepared Licensed Clinical Social Worker. 
                                        After graduating with honors from Michigan State University, I devoted my career to working toward 
                                        empowering individuals and families who are seeking to regain control of their lives. My commitment remains 
                                        steadfast to work with people who are struggling to find their foothold in life due to circumstances beyond their control. 
                                        I firmly believe that it is the strength and resolve of our humanness that brings us to places of higher 
                                        awareness and understanding.  Working together toward self-empowerment through strategic individualized treatment 
                                        goal planning is key.&nbsp;</p>
                                        Lets face it—life can be challenging at times. It is my firm belief that true power comes from seeking to understand why we, 
                                        as human beings, respond to circumstances that occur in our lives in certain ways. A pro-active approach of self-analysis 
                                        promotes the healing process, which allows one to become an active participant in their life.
